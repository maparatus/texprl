# texprl
**T**iny **expr**ession **l**anguage, is a very small language similar to languages found in speadsheets.

The primary aim is to be a language that can be used across maputnik expressions and the fielda form builder. It is therefore a language without a runtime, it just returns a syntax tree in an array syntax suitable for storing in a file/database. See [maplibre-expressions](https://docs.maptiler.com/gl-style-specification/expressions/) for an example.
